Spring boot application to create, read, update and delete data from Mysql database
using the structure below:
-	Config
-	Controlleer
-	Services
-	Repositories

Swagger was added to it, to facilitate testing without using Postman.

Lastly, Flyway was introduced as my database migration and version control tool.
